# Linear-regression-model

## Description
This model is trained on the data of WW2, it takes minimum tempreture as input and predicts maximum tempreture of that time. It uses gradient descent algorithm to make predictions. It is Trained with more than 80,000 training examples, and trained with 100,000 iterations of gradient descent. It took more than 1 hour to train this model.

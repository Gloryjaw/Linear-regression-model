# Linear-regression-model

## Description
This model is trained on the data of WW2, it takes minimum tempreture as input and predicts maximum tempreture of that time. It uses gradient descent algorithm to make predictions. It is code of gradient descent and how its implemented in code. Also, the repository of deployed model is alos in my profile.
